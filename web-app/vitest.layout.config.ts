/**
 * The real-browser layout suite: `yarn test:layout` / `make test-layout`.
 *
 * jsdom has no layout engine, so a test there cannot see a dialog that grows a
 * horizontal scrollbar, a readout that wraps, or a button pushed out of its
 * card — the bugs `docs/ui-layout-rules.md` exists for. This config runs the
 * `*.layout.test.tsx` files in headless Chromium through Vitest browser mode
 * (Playwright), with the app's own Vite pipeline — Tailwind 4, the `@`
 * aliases, the `path` polyfill — so the styles under measurement are the ones
 * the app ships. The setup file loads `src/index.css` and waits for Inter, so
 * every number a test reads comes from the real font.
 *
 * Browser mode over Playwright e2e: the tests render one primitive with real
 * props, exactly like the jsdom suite, and need no built app, no Tauri, no
 * navigation. They read numbers off `getBoundingClientRect`, so a failure
 * names the pixel that is wrong instead of handing over a screenshot.
