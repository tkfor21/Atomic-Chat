/**
 * Domain types for Remote & LAN on the API screen.
 *
 * The wire shape comes from the core's tunnel manager (`atomic-chat-core`,
 * `src/remote-access/`, `RemoteAccessStatus` in its contracts), relayed by
 * Rust. Only `lib/remoteLan.ts` reads that shape; everything else works
 * against the types below.
 *
 * PRIVACY: the tunnel URL and the LAN addresses identify the user's machine.
 * They live in memory only and must never be persisted or sent to analytics.
 * The URL is new on every start anyway, so a saved one would be wrong.
