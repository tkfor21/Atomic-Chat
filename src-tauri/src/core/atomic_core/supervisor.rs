//! Keeping the app attached to a core: find one, start one if there is none,
//! register as a client, and notice when it goes away.
//!
//! The supervisor is the only thing in the app that decides *which* core is the
//! current one. Everything else asks it for the attachment and uses whatever it
//! gets; that is what makes "the core died and a new one took its place"
//! expressible at all — the new attachment has a new generation, and anything
//! still holding the old one is told its data is stale rather than silently
//! reading a mirror of a dead process.
//!
//! Deliberately free of Tauri. The attach state machine is the part with the
//! interesting failure modes, so it is testable against a fake core without an
//! app handle, a webview or a resource bundle.
