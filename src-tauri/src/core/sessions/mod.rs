//! Two halves. `mirror` is the app's copy of the session table of the core process that owns every
//! local runtime; `resolver` is the single question-answering surface over it.
//!
//! Deliberately outside `atomic_core`: the resolver has to be reachable from the proxy and the
//! agent on every target the app builds for, while `atomic_core` needs process inspection that only
//! the desktop targets have. On mobile the resolver answers over an empty mirror.
